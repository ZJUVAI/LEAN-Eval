Let O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, √3/2) be points in the coordinate plane. 
Let F be the family of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant 
with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. There is a unique point C on AB, 
distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. 
Then OC² = p/q, where p and q are coprime positive integers. Find p + q.
