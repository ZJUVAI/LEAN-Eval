Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. 
The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. 
Find the side length of the hexagon.

Note: The actual proof would require more detailed geometric reasoning and solving the system of equations, but this sets up the structure of the problem in Lean. The key insight is that the hexagon's side length is 400/3, which comes from solving the system of equations formed by the triangle side lengths.
